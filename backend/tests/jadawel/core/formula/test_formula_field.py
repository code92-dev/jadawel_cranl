def test_json_formula_field_get_prep_value_does_not_mutate_input():
    """
    Regression: `get_prep_value` minifies the formula paths in a config, but it
    must NOT mutate the value it is given — that value is the model instance's
    in-memory `config` attribute, and mutating it as a side effect of preparing
    the DB value is unsafe.

    Why it matters (the silk-driven bug): django-silk (enabled in the dev env)
    wraps `SQLCompiler.execute_sql` and compiles each UPDATE twice — once to log
    the query, once to actually run it — so `get_prep_value` runs twice on the
    *same* config object within a single save. Before the deepcopy fix the first
    call minified the config in place (`{"formula": ...}` -> `{"f": ...}`) and the
    second call re-minified the already-minified form; `_transform_python_property`
    reads the "formula" key (absent after minify), so it wrote back `{"f": ""}` and
    the formula was silently blanked. This is what made table-element duplication
    lose every field formula when silk was on. Keeping `get_prep_value` free of
    side effects makes it idempotent regardless of how many times it runs.
