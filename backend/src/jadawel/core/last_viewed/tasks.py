    cost a task, two queries and a row lock. The lock was taken when the task was
    enqueued, so its lifetime is re-armed from the moment of the write; otherwise
    a delay in the queue would let it expire before the floor does. A run that
    wrote nothing releases it, otherwise an item that could not be resolved would
