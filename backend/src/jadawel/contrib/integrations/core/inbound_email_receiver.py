"""
Deletes handed-over messages from the bundled inbound mail server (mox).

Mox writes every accepted message to disk before posting the incoming-delivery
webhook and never removes it: it has no retention setting. Its web API can
delete a message by id, and every webhook carries the id of the message it is
about, so `InboundEmailHandler.handle_webhook_payload` queues the deletion of
each message it is handed, whatever it then does with it. Deleting a message
whose webhook is still being retried is safe: mox retries from its own stored
copy of the payload, and Jadawel never reads a message back. The one thing this
does not cover is a message whose webhook never reaches the backend at all,
which happens when the backend stays unreachable for longer than mox retries
(roughly 32 hours).
